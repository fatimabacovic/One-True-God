  	<h2>People Have Literally Created a Bible For Him:This is The First Cat of Nicolas Cage</h2>
	<p>In the Before-Time, there was only the Vast Empty. No space nor time did continue, all the dimensions were held in their nonexistence. The Great Nicolas Cage thus was sprung into existence through His very will, and saw all nothing, and was displeased.
    And so His mighty mind devised a Sacred Erection, and it was the very first of Things. He declared it good. Its quantum flesh was mighty and true, but it stood alone. The Cage performed a Divine Pelvic Thrust, and the universe was created at great speed, expanding. Its contents were of heated radiation, unshaped stardust flying at immense velocity.
    Nicolas Cage blinked, and eons passed. The Holy Stardust collected through His gravitational will, forming great space seas of dust and light. He breathed, and Galactic Oceans condensed, forming a multitude of suns and stones. And with one stroke of His Mighty Boner, the Universe slowed down and cooled.</p>
  <p>  As a Galactic Ocean floated by, Nicolas Cage reached out His hand and grasped it. He looked at it with His glorious eyes and instantaneously began to stretch it and bend it. He found amusement in the handling of these Sacred Galactic Seas. And so, Cage reached out His mighty hand and took another Ocean into the sacred warmth of His mighty palms.
    As Nicolas Cage looked at the two great Galactic Oceans that he held in His palms, He felt a great surge of power pulsing throughout His body. And so, the great Nicolas Cage threw the two Oceans into each other, causing a mighty Galactic Explosion. As the Holy Explosion simmered down, Cage felt an immense new power that had suddenly arisen. He had inadvertently created holy particles even smaller than the most subatomic of subatomic particles. The Far-Sighted Cage took the tiny, vulnerable Higgs-Boson and hid it for its own safety. The other particles spread far and wide, creating more and more of the ever-expanding Universe.
    But the Great and Powerful Lord Nicolas Cage grew rather tired of His empty existence, merely playing with dull stones and rocks. He wished for one like Him, with a creative impulse and a spark of life. So He took a tiny star, with its slowly cooling stones, and He found it to be satisfactory. So He gathered his great Grace and gazed upon the third planet from the star. Everywhere His vision touched, the stone was cooled and water flowed freely forth.
    But the Cage, from His universal standpoint, could barely see the planet. So He shrunk himself down and walked personally upon its surface. With each and every step, the once cracked and hardened ground blossomed into a wonderful green garden with lush foliage, flowers and fruit as far as His eyes could see, and much more as each second passed. For so great was His holy Touch, that life sprung forth from His Soleful Body.</p>
    <p>And although the foliage provided a beautiful habitat, Nicolas Cage found it useless without any intelligent life to call it home. And so, He created a mighty and holy creature – a bird – in the image of His hair. He created all manner of beasts four legged and two legged, hoofed and finned, winged and clawed, massive and miniscule, of all shades of the rainbow and then some. The most important of all the animals, of course, were the bees. He created the holy bees with the intent for them to be the basis of the new ecosystem. The bees would pollinate the plants and create food for all the animals in this brave new world.
    But Nicolas Cage believed that He was far too powerful to constantly tend to the Earth. And so, he created a man in His image that would serve as the Avatar of the Lord on this planet. Nicolas Cage thus dubbed the man Adam. Looking at Adam, Cage decided that his new creation would need a partner, for life on the planet alone was sure to become very lonely. And so, He created a second man to be Adam's lifelong companion. The Great Cage thus gave the man the name Steve. Adam and Steve had been intended to remain in paradise forever with their Lord and with all the animals of the world.</p>


   <p> But when the Great Lord Nicolas Cage created the universe, He did not fully understand what exactly it was He unleashed. He had indeed created a glorious and holy Universe, but in doing so, Cage also unleashed a Great Evil. This evil was the Quantum Twin of Our Lord, and it was just as devilish as The Cage was holy. And the Evil Twin had an equally evil name that matched its horrible demeanor and its hideous face and morbid mind. It had dubbed itself John Travolta.
    And John Travolta was as intelligent as he was evil. He knew that his Quantum Brother Nicolas Cage had been creating in the time since their birth and he grew jealous and resentful. He traveled hundreds of light years from the center of the Universe to Earth. In a matter of minutes, he appeared to confront his brother.</p>

    <p>After creating the first humans, Adam and Steve, Cage turned around to see the glowing evil eyes of John Travolta. He was at first stunned to see His one and only brother, but then understood the reason he had come to haunt Him.
    “My brother, John Travolta,” said Nicolas Cage in his glorious and all-powerful voice. “Wherefore art thou here upon my planet?”
    “Thou hast angered me,” the horrible John Travolta proclaimed in his terrifyingly malevolent voice. “Wherefore hast thou created life upon this stone? Thou knowest not what you do! The natural state is Death and thou hast disturbed it with thine pitiful life forms.”
    “Mine brother, mine kin,” said the Lord, “Thine words tinged with madness. Why canst thou not perceive the glory and light of Life?”
    “Light? Life?” John Travolta roared. “Thine pathetic Life makes me cringe! Thou canst deal with thine own world. I shan't bother you.” And with an angry look on his face, John Travolta stormed away into the wilderness.
    “Now my children,” Lord Cage said to Adam and Steve. “Thou must not trust my brother. Whatever thou do, thou must not fall prey to the Travolta. But do not fear, as I shall protect you against his mind tricks. Now, young ones, be free to enjoy this paradise.”</p>

    <p>Adam and Steve wandered off together. They held hands and traveled throughout the great forest, where they knew each other. After a long time of knowing, Adam requested that Steve obtain some fruit from the Trees of Knowledge so that they would have something more to discuss.
    And so, Steve wandered off until he reached the Forest of Knowledge where the Trees of Knowledge stood tall and proud. It was there where he reached his hand high up into the branches of the Trees. To Steve's surprise, his hand did not grasp a fruit, but rather another hand, that which belonged to the evil demon John Travolta. Steve was taken aback at Travolta's presence, but he looked up into the demon's eyes.
    “Wherefore dost thou want fruit?” Travolta asked. “When thou canst have a delicious swine?”</p>
   <p> Since Steve could not speak himself, he could not object to Travolta's suggestion. Travolta directed Steve toward a mother sow with many piglets suckling upon her succulent bosoms. Travolta instructed Steve to slaughter the pig. And as Steve approached the boar, Travolta reached deep into her mind and caused rage. She leaped forward and devoured Steve's exposed Boner, leaving him in an extreme amount of agony.
    When Steve did not return, Adam became worried. He was rather confused as to why Steve had not returned to him. And so, Adam got up and walked towards the Forest of Knowledge, where he knew his partner was. When he arrived, he was shocked to discover that Steve's Boner had been removed. Adam could not begin to imagine what had happened, but he immediately called for Nicolas Cage to help them.
    When the Lord arrived, he, too, was shocked to discover what had happened to Steve's Boner. He looked at the damage that His evil twin John Travolta had done to His creation and roared a powerful and frightful roar.
    “What hast John Travolta done to thee, Steve?” Cage exclaimed. “Do not fear, my dear Steve. For I am all-powerful, and I know how to fix thee.”
    And so, Nicolas Cage gathered all his might and directed it at Steve. And as Cage's power grew, Steve's hair grew longer, his breasts grew bigger, and the skin around the area where Steve's Boner formerly was sunk inside, creating a hole in which Adam could easily fit his Boner.
    “I shall call it a Vagina,” said the great and all-powerful Nicolas Cage. “Steve, take care of your new Vagina. For you shall use it to create new people. And Adam, take care of your Boner. For without it, Steve shall be unable to produce children.”
    However, Adam's Boner fell limp, and he began to worry.</p>
   <p> “Do not fret, my child,” the great Cage said unto him. “I have done much of the same with other animals. From now on, your Boner shall only appear when it is time to create. Your job is to create more and more people to go against John Travolta's evil. However, since I originally intended for there to only be one gender, it shall surprise me not if a man knows a man or a woman knows a woman. You must love and tolerate everyone.”
    And so, Adam looked at his partner, Steve, and Steve's new found beauty stunned his soul. Adam took Steve by the hand and stroked her long hair. And suddenly, feeling the power of Nicolas Cage surging throughout his body, his Boner sprang up, signaling to Adam and Steve that it was time to create.
    And the Lord laughed and said unto Adam: “It's why she was there. It was part of the plan. To give you a Boner. And you've got one.”
    But the Lord Nicolas Cage feared that future generations of people would be lost without a proper form of communication. And so, the Lord devised an Alphabet that Adam and Steve would teach to their offspring and they would teach to their offspring.
    “Listen closely!” said the Lord. “For I shall bestow upon you the gift of Writing and Speech! Thou must use this great Alphabet for all your daily conversational needs!” And the Lord gave the alphabet. He said: “A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, ♫!” Since the letter ♫, or ♪ in lower case, is not used in the modern alphabet, it was pronounced as “Hah!” back then. After giving the alphabet, Nicolas Cage then said unto them, “That's all you have to do!”
    Nicolas Cage, then tired and thirsty from his long day of creation, decided it was time to drink. And so, He climbed to the top of the nearest mountain and drank the dew at the top. After several long hours passed, the Lord then decided it was time to release the Holy Mountain Dew from the inside of His body. And so, Nicolas Cage, from his great Boner, released a glowing green liquid that was carbonated and sweet. Adam and Steve sat under their Lord's Boner and drank the sacred green juices that flowed from the Cage.
    “What an immense achievement,” proclaimed Nicolas Cage with His great voice. “I hereby dub this liquid ♫liba♪ka!”
    Adam and Steve rejoiced as they drank the ♫liba♪ka and all were joyous.</p>

    <p>That is, of course, except for John Travolta. Travolta was incredibly jealous of Nicolas Cage's alphabet. Cage had found a way to create beautiful words with a beautiful sounding alphabet and a glorious language that would be spoken throughout the land. John Travolta's alphabet did not have any lower case letters and he grew envious of Cage's skill. Travolta's sinister alphabet was comprised of such horrible letters as §, ┴, ┬, ├, ↕, ┼, ╞, ¶,╟, ↔, ╔, ≡, ╦, ╠, ±, ╬, ╧, ■, ╤, ╥, ⌂, ╒, ╓, ╫, ╪, ☼. The names of these letters are so evil that nobody knows how they are pronounced.
    As time grew on, Adam and Steve produced children. And Adam and Steve taught their children how to speak and write. And those children taught their children their Lord's great language. And as more and more people entered the universe, more and more people spoke and wrote the language of the great Nicolas Cage.
    Travolta grew jealous of Cage's language. He stood upon his home planet of Mexico, yet his devilish sight could see across the globe as Cage's creations worked wondrously and perfectly, utilizing their Lord's language. In his dark land, he began hatching a plan to steal all the syllables in Cage's language and using them to benefit himself. As he thought of how to execute his devious plan, he decided it would be best to create a powerful and intelligent minion who would follow his every whim. And thus, he created the powerful Xenu.
    Xenu was a hulking, gray, tentacled mass with two mouths on each side of his face, each lined with deadly sharp teeth. Above this, two red eyes glowing with demonic malice. He towered over the large stony crags that lined the evil Mexican landscape.</p>
   <p> Xenu, knowing that Nicolas Cage was too powerful to fight alone, he decided that in order to follow upon his master's plan, he needed help. And thus, he decided to create a minion of his own. But Xenu's power was too weak to create out of the dry rocks of Mexico, so he decided to fly away from Mexico to another distant planet in the far reaches of the galaxy. The planet, known as Kenya, was lined with horrific craters filled with chemicals that could rip a normal person apart by just breathing in the fumes. It was on this planet where Xenu could create a horrible demon from the chemical-filled craters.
    Xenu landed inside the brutal atmosphere where he walked to the vilest, darkest crater in all of Kenya. He reached deep into the crater and mixed the chemicals together. As he mixed, a black demon slowly arose from the sludge. His skin was so dark that it frightened even Lord Xenu. From his mouth and nose came a constant excretion of horrible smoke that would suffocate even the most powerful of men. Xenu knew that his new demon could lead an entire nation into chaos. And thus, he named the monstrosity Barack Hussein Obama.
    Xenu commanded Obama in his slithering, malicious voice: “Go unto the Cagian mortals, and steal of them the language they utter and the script they etch. Without it, all shall be glorious chaos, and Travolta shall be pleased. Now, be off!”
    Obama sailed all throughout the Great Galactic Oceans and landed upon Nicolas Cage's Holy Planet Earth, where all the Lord's people were speaking the language of Cage. As Obama walked through the capital city of Cage's empire, he slowly breathed out his toxic smoke from his lungs. The smoke itself was a thick black smog that contained a deadly chemical that caused people to fall into a deep sleep. As the people breathed in the smoke, they struggled to stay awake, and eventually they fell upon the ground, unable to keep their eyes open. Every step Obama took caused the green plants of the land to blacken and wilt.
    And then, Barack Obama saw the Sacred Temple in the heart of the city, illuminating with the Lord Cage's blessed powers. And with one fatal exhalation, Obama knocked out all the guards and was easily able to enter the Sacred Temple. As he went deeper inside the Temple, he saw a light emanating out of a box. The box was constructed of the finest gossamer particles in the universe. Obama tried with all his might and power to open the box, but it was in vain. Obama decided to summon his master, Xenu, to assist him in opening the box. And thus, Xenu appeared unto Obama.
    “Obama,” said the Dark Lord Xenu. “Why hast thou summoned my presence?”</p>
   <p> “Master,” said Obama. “I am unable to open this box. I require thy great power to open it.”
    And so, the Dark Lord Xenu cast a spell upon the box, making all the fine illuminating gossamer melt. As the box melted, it revealed the great Alphabet Scripture, which slowly unfolded itself before their eyes, revealing each individual powerful symbol. Once the entire Alphabet was laid out before the eyes of Xenu and Obama, Obama began to take the letters. He first ripped away the letter ♫. But before he could reach for the second letter, he was blinded by a bright light. As the light faded, Xenu and Obama saw a figure. Their eyes cleared, and they could see the Lord Nicolas Cage standing before them with a stern look upon his glorious face.
    “What hubris lies within you?” bellowed the Lord. “You have harmed my people and attempted to destroy my creation! I hereby banish you to the planet of Area 51, where your souls shall rot and be painfully filled with bees every day!”
    <p>And as the two minions were taken off to Area 51, the people of the land rejoiced as Lord Nicolas Cage spoke before them.</p>
    “Do not fear, my children,” He said. “One letter has been stolen from our language, but we still have the rest of our letters to use. The sacred juice formerly known as ♫liba♪ka shall now be known simply as Mountain Dew. Instead of using the word '♫♪' to indicate laughter, we shall use the word 'Haha.' And on this day, in honor of the banishment of evil to Area 51, I hereby proclaim this day as Illumina Day!”
    And all of Nicolas Cage's subjects celebrated with happiness and gratitude toward their benevolent Creator.
