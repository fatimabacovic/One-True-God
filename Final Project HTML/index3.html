  	<h2>Sometimes In Life you make many mistakes.</h2>
	<p>Nicolas Cage is an American actor, director, and producer.  He was born in Long Beach, California on January 7, 1964. He was raised a Catholic, but that didn't stop him from creating a whole new religion. He's the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola so you know that he was destined for greatness.  It runs through his veins like the wine you drink at church that is assumed to be blood. </p>
	<p>Ironically enough, Cage avoids talking about religion in interviews. He claims that he doesn't ever want to preach or tie religion into his work.  Again, this has not stopped him from becoming a religious icon. </p>
	<p> Cage has been called one of the most generous stars in Hollywood.  He donated $2 million to Amnesty International for them to use to offer rehabilitation shelters, medical services and psychological and reintegration services to some of the 300,000 children forced to fight in conflicts across the world.  He has also donated $1 million to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. He became the first artist to support ArtWorks, an artist engagement program to raise awareness of fundamental rights at work, including freedom from slavery and from child labor.  Cage has also been honored with Humanitarian award from United Nations for his works and appointed as an UN ambassador for Global Justice in 2009 and again in 2013.He led a campaign around the film Lord of War to raise awareness about international arms control, supported "Heal the Bay," the United Negro College Fund efforts, and the Royal United Hospital's Forever Friends Appeal to build intensive care units for babies. </p>
	<p>It is no surprise that a man this generous has aleviated the woes of many.  He has heard our cries and taken us into his arms as we wept.  In moments of weakness we may cry out, no one knows what it's like, no one understand.  But this forgotten son of god knows.  He is our shepard, and he will lead us home.</p>
