  	<h2>Sometimes In Life you make many mistakes.</h2>
	<p>You have regrets.  You make bad decisions.  You find yourself on reddit at 3am wondering what you're doing 	with your life.  You realize what a failure you are.</p>
	<p>As your poor soul cries out for help, he finds you.</p>
	<p> He takes you in, and leads you into temptation and towards evil.</p>
	<p> In the beginning, the earth was formless and empty. But it wasnâ€™t the spirit of God that hovered over the dark waters and gave the world light. It was actor Nicolas Cage.</p>
	<p>Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done.  We shall forever 	trust the saviour, Nicolas Cage</p>

  <p><center>"Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the name of the LORD Nicolas Cage: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of reddit, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD. Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven."
