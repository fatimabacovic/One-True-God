  	<h2>I'm Not Crazy, I swear</h2>
	<p>I know exactly what you're thinking.  Holy schnikeys, does this woman actually believe the things that she's putting onto this site?  Does She honestly think this stuff is real? </p>
	<p>Of course I do! I mean, if it's on the internet, it must be true!  Wait a second...I'm the one who made this site, I can't trust anything that comes out of my mouth, I'm a notorious pathological liar.</p>
	<p> I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  I'm not a nut who escaped from the shell and I'm not a pathological liar(unless  I'm drunk).  It's a meme guys.  And quite a funny one if I do say so myself.  </p>
	<p>Basically, this all started out when some dude decided to make parody videos about Nicolas Cage.  From there it sort of just escalated.  It didn't help that he's done so many terrible movies because he's terrible with his finances and needs the money. </p>
    <p>The start of the actual meme's of good old Saint Nic started with a meme where his hair was digitally manipulated in the shape of an eagle and a caption reading: "My Hair is a Bird; Your Argument is Invalid." was given.  From there, a tumblr page originated that was dedicated to photoshopping Nicolas Cage's face onto other people and is commonly known as the meme "Nicolas Cage as Everyone".  </p>
    <p> I, honest to Nic Cage, (ha, do you see what I did there) cannot find how the "One True God" meme originated but I'm honestly not mad at it.  It's a comedic relief to a very intense topic.  I don't know why I'm obsessed with it enough to dedicate an entire website to it, but I did so umm, yeah.  Whew, that was awkward, I almost had to tell you I'm secretely insanely obssessed with Nicolas Cage and that he's my favorite actor. </p>
